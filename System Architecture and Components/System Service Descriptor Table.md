# Summary
In this post, we will try to take a look and understand what System Service Descriptor Table or SSDT is and understand it with WinDbg tool. Also we will take an example of how when and exe is booted and how Ntdll.dll file is called.

**Note -  System Service Descriptor Table is a vast topic and complex to understand but I will try explain to you and understand myselfüòÖüòÖ**

# What is System Service Descriptor Table?
As per the resources, simply is an array of addresses to kernel routines for 32 bit operating systems or an array of relative offsets to the same routines for 64 bit operating systems. SSDT is the first member of the Service Descriptor Table kernel memory structure as shown below.
```CPP
typedef struct tagSERVICE_DESCRIPTOR_TABLE {
    SYSTEM_SERVICE_TABLE nt; //effectively a pointer to Service Dispatch Table (SSDT) itself
    SYSTEM_SERVICE_TABLE win32k;
    SYSTEM_SERVICE_TABLE sst3; //pointer to a memory address that contains how many routines are defined in the table
    SYSTEM_SERVICE_TABLE sst4;
} SERVICE_DESCRIPTOR_TABLE;
```
Well even I didn't understood the definition properly so finding other resources gives a bit more clarity. Here I will explain you with an example. 

Refer the diagram below.

Suppose there is a process running called "Notepad.exe" that wants to write data or save file to the disk. For this to happen it will call an API called **[CreateFileA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea)** from the **Kernel32.dll** file which is a type of DLL that exposes majority of the Win32 APIs to the applications. Now we will try to understand how notepad calls Win32 API and where does SSDT stands.

Let's try to dive-in and understand better.

We will continue our previous example, notepad.exe wants to write to the disk so it will call **CreateFileA** API from the **Kernel32.dll** which in turn calls another API internally called **[NtCreateFile](http://undocumented.ntinternals.net/index.html?page=UserMode%2FUndocumented%20Functions%2FNT%20Objects%2FFile%2FNtCreateFile.html)** which is called from **Ntdll.dll** file which resides in the userland located in This file is located in the System and System32 system directories. The description of the file is NT Layer DLL. It‚Äôs essentially a DLL file that contains core NT kernel functions. 

The code of **NtCreateFile** is responsible to make system call i.e **Syscall** or **Sysenter**, after that the **Ntoskrnl.exe** that resides in the kernel space will call the kernel version of the **NtCreateFile** which in fact is same i.e **NtCreateFile** which does the actual work. **Now the SSDT table is used to find out absolute address of the kernel mode version of the NtCreateFile**. Now that we have idea of where does the SSDT table lies in the picture. We can move to how SSDT works and try to understand it more better. Before we move forward, keep the above diagram in mind to get the bigger picture.
