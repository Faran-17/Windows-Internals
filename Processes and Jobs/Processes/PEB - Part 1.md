# Summary
In this blog, we will take a look at what PEB is and it's inner workings using the a debugger. This will be a multipart series of blogs where I try to cover and understand different parameters of the PEB and it's structure. References are mentioned at the end.

# What is PEB?
PEB is the representation of a process in the user space. This is the user-mode structure that has the most knowledge about a process. It contains direct details on the process, and many pointers to other structs holding even more data on the PE. Any process with a slightest user-mode footprint will have a corresponding PEB structure. The PEB is created by the kernel but is mostly operated from user-mode. It is used to store data that is managed by the user-mode, hence providing easier data access than transition to kernel mode or inter process communication. 

# Structure of the PEB

Here is the representation of where PEB lies in the Windows architecture.

In the above diagram, we can see that the PEB structure lies on the user space. However, there is more into it. Let's understand it in a very simple way. 

The kernel space in the Windows OS is divided into three parts, the HAL, the Kernel and the Executive Subsystem. The Executive subsystem deals with general OS policies and operation, the Kernel deals with process architecture details and low-level operations. The HAL deals with differences that arise in particular implementations of a processor architecture. Although they have their own complexity which are topics of their own.

So when we create a new process, both the Kernel and Executive Subsystem wants to track it, for thier own purposes. The structure that the Kernel uses to track the process is the KPROCESS and the structure that the Executive Subsystems use to track it is the EPROCESS. Also if we consider, the KPROCESS is the first field of the EPROCESS. Let's take a look at it's structure in a Kernel debugger.

```

  +0x0c8 VirtualSize      : Uint4B

  +0x114 SectionBaseAddress : Ptr32 Void
  +0x118 QuotaBlock       : Ptr32 _EPROCESS_QUOTA_BLOCK
```
We can see that is the very first field is the KPROCESS. If we look KPROCESS structure it is represented as -

```

```
The same logic is applied the process's threads in representation of ETHREAD and KTHREAD. The PEB comes from the Thread Environment Block (TEB) which also happens to be commonly referred to as the Thread Information Block (TIB). The TEB is responsible for holding data about the current thread – every thread has
it’s own TEB structure.

I've explained all this term in a very basic way but under the hood things get a little complext and Each structure deservers it's own attention and time which we will do in the future blogs.

Before we move forwards, let's understand the basic flow of creation of and where everything fits.  
1. 

Let's take a look at the PEB structure asn per official **[MSDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/ns-winternl-peb)**.
```Cpp
typedef struct _PEB {
  BYTE                          Reserved1[2];
  BYTE                          BeingDebugged;
  BYTE                          Reserved2[1];
  PVOID                         Reserved3[2];
  PPEB_LDR_DATA                 Ldr;
  PRTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS  ProcessParameters;
  PVOID                         Reserved4[3];
  PVOID                         AtlThunkSListPtr;
  PVOID                         Reserved5;
  ULONG                         Reserved6;
  PVOID                         Reserved7;
  ULONG                         Reserved8;
  ULONG                         AtlThunkSListPtr32;
  PVOID                         Reserved9[45];
  BYTE                          Reserved10[96];
  PPS_POST_PROCESS_INIT_ROUTINE PostProcessInitRoutine;
  BYTE                          Reserved11[128];
  PVOID                         Reserved12[1];
  ULONG                         SessionId;
} PEB, *PPEB;
```
