# Summary
In this blog, we will take a deep dive inside on how a normal process is created in a Windows environment. We will start by writing a short code to create a simple process then debug it via debugger to understand it's internal working and also we will be taking a look at how to create a process via NTAPIs. 

Note - All the references, credits and codes will mentioned in this blog.
